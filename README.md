## About me

Hello, my name is Constantino E. Carranza, currently residing in Querétaro, México. My main interests involve old stuff in general, computers and nature. I obtained a Physics Engineering bachelors degree from the Autonomous University of Querétaro back in the summer of 2021, and have been working as an engineer since. My mother tongue is Spanish, but ever since I was in my early teens I started to learn English, mostly by playing video games online, so thank God for Call of Duty. During my university years I studied other languages, thought most of them (French, German and Czech) I took only because I had to comply with 8 semesters of compulsory language classes. The only language that I started learning because of personal interest was Japanese, and did so for a couple of years before dropping it altogether (until a couple of months ago). 

## About this page

This page is intended to be a place to share any project that I might consider interesting, if one ever makes it that far. I´d like this to be just a place for me to write about things that interest me in general, mostly just for me to have them documented, but hopefully someone finds worth on them as well.
